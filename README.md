# D3-trends-visualization. 
Show a scatter plot between two data variables analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

The data contains a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The idea is to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates:
[https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

# Basic Folder

Using D3 techniques, a scatter plot is created to represents each state with circle elements. The scatter plot looks very similar to next image:

![scatter](images/scatter.png)

The plot:
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Situates the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

# Adv Folder

Following the same idea from the basic folder. 
An interactive chart is created with animations. The results of this part will look similar to next gif image. This interaction is given by selecting the options from X and Y axes to compare different cariables.
